# ive-been-there

Where I have been? Where I lived? And where I still want to go?

Includes: `lived`, `visited`, `airport`, `want-to-go`.

### Contribute

Suggest me new places

### Run

    node index.js

or

	node index.js -v

for the verbose version. Only difference is that it prints the list of `lived`, `visited`, `airport` and `want-to-go` countries
