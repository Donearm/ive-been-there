# ive-been-there

Where I have been? Where I lived? And where I still want to go?

Includes: `lived`, `visited`, `airport`, `want-to-go`.

### Contribute

Suggest me new places

### Run

    node index.js

or

	node index.js -v

for the verbose version. Only difference is that it prints the list of `lived`, `visited`, `airport` and `want-to-go` countries

Differently, adding or using `-c`

	node index.js -c

will show a list of every city visited. This option can be used in combination with the verbose one, to have a full representation of all visited countries and cities
